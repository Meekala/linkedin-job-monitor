# 🔒 Deployment Security Checklist

## ✅ Before Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables Security
- [ ] All sensitive data moved to Railway environment variables
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore` 
- [ ] No Discord webhook URLs in code
- [ ] No database credentials in code
- [ ] No API keys hardcoded anywhere

### 2. Code Security
- [ ] Input sanitization enabled (`_sanitize_text()`)
- [ ] Discord webhook URL validation active
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs (checked logging statements)
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented (respects LinkedIn/Discord limits)
- [ ] Error handling prevents information leakage

### 3. Railway Security Settings
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway dashboard (not in code)
- [ ] Private repository or secure public repo
- [ ] Automatic deployment from main branch only
- [ ] Restart policy configured (prevents infinite loops)

## 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** (with .env excluded)
2. **Connect Railway to GitHub**
3. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway dashboard
4. **Deploy and Monitor**

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Check Railway logs for any sensitive data leaks
- [ ] Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- [ ] Test Discord notifications work
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours to ensure stability
- [ ] Check that no personal data appears in logs

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

If webhook URLs are compromised:
1. Immediately regenerate Discord webhooks
2. Update Railway environment variables
3. Redeploy application
4. Monitor Discord for unauthorized messages

If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs (but never share publicly)
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check GitHub repository privacy settings
4. Restart deployment with fresh environment
